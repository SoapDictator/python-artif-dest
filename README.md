# python-artif-dest
This is functional prototype of a turn-based strategy game by the name of "Artificially Destined".

## Prerequisites
- Python 2.7 should be installed (this code should also run on Python 3+, but it was not tested properly)

## How To Use
1. Launch start.bat file
```start.bat
python AD.py
```
2. You are ready to go! Keybinds should be displayed on the screen, go wild.

Currently the game only has a "singleplayer" mode, so you can't play with your friends just yet. Also, the game is currently in the process to switching to OpenGL graphics (from PyGame ones), so most of the features are not functioning.
